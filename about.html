				<p id="objectivepara">In order to improve the students' speech and learning ability, each member will share their Chinese history and culture in order to enrich students' knowledge and understanding of Chinese culture. Through the exchange platform of HYTF, more and more people will experience the charm of Chinese cultures and learn them easily through communication and sharing in the future. The idea is that the development of the Chinese history and culture lecture such that this is conducive for students to become initiative learning. This better allows students to absorb and learn the history knowledge on their own which they previously considered tedious. In addition, members in HYTF will share courseware content with other members in a simple and easy-to-understand manner in order to promote them to develop good habits of preparation before class, self-learning, and language organization.</p>
